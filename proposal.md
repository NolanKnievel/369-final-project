## New York City Taxi Trip Analysis Proposal

1. What question are you trying to answer?
    How do external factors (like weather and COVID) change taxi demand and patterns across NYC?

2. Why is this question worth answering?
    Our transport systems can be indicative of social behavior. Understanding how taxis respond to disruption and help us understand how people respond to disruptions.  

    Understanding how taxi usage responds to disruptions can help cities plan infrastructure and emergency responses.

3. What is your hypothesis? What leads you towards that hypothesis?

    Taxi demand responds unevenly to external shocks. Impact on different neighborhoods, and by extension different economic classes, will vary. 

    My hypothesis stems from past research and observation. Transportation access is different between societal classes, and I'm curious to see if this is reflected in taxi data. 


4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? 
    My primary dataset is the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission trip record data. This contains trip records including timestamps, pickup/dropoff locations, fares, and tips. I'm planning to analyze record data from 2019.
