## New York City Taxi Data Analysis Proposal


1. What question are you trying to answer?

    How do external factors (like weather and COVID) change taxi demand and patterns across NYC?

2. Why is this question worth answering?

    Our transport systems can be indicative of social behavior. Understanding how taxis respond to disruption and help us understand how people respond to disruptions.  

3. What is your hypothesis? What leads you towards that hypothesis?

    Taxi demand responds unevenly to external shocks. Impact on different neighborhoods, and by extension different economic classes, will vary. 

    My hypothesis stems from past research and observation. Transportation access is different between social classes, and I'm curious to see how this is reflected in taxi data. 

4. Dataset
    I'm workign with the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission trip record dataset. This contains trip records including timestamps, pickup/dropoff locationss, fares, and tips. I'm planning to analyze data from 2019.
